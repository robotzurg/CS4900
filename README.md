# CS 4900 Capstone Project (Waveform)
### By Jeff Turpin

Waveform is a music reviewing platform where users can share their insights on tracks, albums, EPs, and artists, and get tailored recommendations based on what genres and music they tend to rate highly. Waveform is designed to foster a community of music enthusiasts through users sharing their thoughts on various music genres and albums, and helping people find new music to listen to based on what they enjoy, as well as giving critics a place to spotlight their reviews and publications about music.
